A repository containing work with support vector machines (SVMs) and least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) in particular. Included are experiments with classification, function estimation, (automated) parameter tuning, Bayesian optimisation, automatic relevance detection, robust regression, time series prediction, large-scale problems (using the Nystr√∂m method or network committees) and multiclass classification. Spectral clustering and kernel principal component analysis are considered as well. Some basic tests on well-known datasets (such as the Pima indian diabetes -, California housing - and Santa Fe chaotic laser data) are applied.
